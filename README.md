# Qubes_OQubes OS stands out as one of the most secure operating systems, utilizing compartmentalization to isolate tasks in separate virtual machines (qubes). Developed by Joanna Rutkowska, it prioritizes security over convenience, requiring high-end hardware like a 64-bit CPU, 16GB RAM, and TPM support. Unlike traditional VMs, it demands direct hardware access, making it incompatible with VMware. Its use of the Xen hypervisor enforces isolation and secures inter-qube communication, ensuring minimal risk of breaches. The disposable VMs and secure GUI integration make its security model particularly fascinating. Despite its steep hardware requirements, I am eager to master Qubes OS, as its security-first approach aligns with my interest in attack-resistant computing systems.S_Installation
